The time domain approach which assumes that correlation between adjacent points in time is best explained in terms of a dependence of the current value on past values. This focuses on modeling some future value of a time series as a parametric function of the current and past values, usually by decomposing components of time series data.  Another approach develops a systematic class of models called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to handle time-correlated modeling and forecasting, with a provision for treating more than one input series through multivariate ARIMA.

      "Language can be considered our “sixth sense” that has literally made humans the dominant species on the planet and made modern human civilization possible. It is the primary mechanism used throughout human history to communicate and share knowledge both across society and across generations. One of the holy grails of AI is to build Machines that can “understand” (analyze), “generate” (synthesize), and “translate” language the way humans do so that we can communicate with machines in our natural languages the way we communicate with each other.This course introduces the major challenges of, and classic approaches to, Natural Language Processing (NLP) at a beginning graduate level.  The course takes a functional approach — developing data representations and algorithms based on analysis of what is required by key uses of language — as well as considering the critical properties of language with respect to these uses.  The primary focus is on developing applications to enable computer\n",
