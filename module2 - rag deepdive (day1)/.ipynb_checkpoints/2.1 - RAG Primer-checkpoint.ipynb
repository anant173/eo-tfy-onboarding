Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https: //layout-parser . github. io|\\n\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis - Deep Learning - Layout Analysis - Character Recognition - Open Source library - Toolkit.')"

      "However, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re- cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [I] or PyTorch be obfuscated by implementation details and the high-level parameters can . It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel.\n",

This focuses on modeling some future value of a time series as a parametric function of the current and past values, usually by decomposing components of time series data.  Another approach develops a systematic class of models called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to handle time-correlated modeling and forecasting, with a provision for treating more than one input series through multivariate ARIMA.

Every successful product that we use today is addressing a very critical human need, addressing an important individual, industrial, or societal pain point, and has evolved over multiple iterations through a very well defined process that has now matured into what we call “Design Thinking”. Traditionally, the design thinking process is taught mostly to product managers, customer experience designers, and growth managers. But as the charter of AI/DS is evolving from merely “embedding intelligence into existing products and services” to “building intelligent solutions for society”, it becomes critical for AI architects and Data Scientists to also become first principles “product thinkers” and “design thinkers”. This hands-on Holistic Learning Module on Design Thinking will explore the core guiding principles and a systematic process of both conceiving new, and continuously improving existing products by identifying the right pain points and\n",

The next generation products will be complex digital-physical ecosystem products such as telecom networks, e-commerce platforms, agriculture and healthcare for a country, smart cities of the future, and so on. Today these third generation products are put together by clobbering together existing building blocks giving a very siloed experience to customers, a broken architecture to engineers, and a fragmented and inefficient design of operations. A whole new set of skills are needed to conceive, design, build, and operate such ecosystem products that will require a new kind of integrated operating system that doesn't exist yet. The Holistic Learning Module on System and Solution Thinking will develop the required skills to not just build and deploy bottom-up AI/ML models wrapped in microservices but to build a\n",
